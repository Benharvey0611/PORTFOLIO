  COURSE GOALS ACOMPLISHED THROUGH MAKINGS 1-9:
  Engaging in sustainable resarch has sharpened my information allocation
  skills as I've had to dive into several YouTube videos and online
  forums for code knowledge exchange in order to hone in on a particular
  set of interests surrounding new digital media. Learning to play with
  webtext during the beginning of the course proved to be useful later
  down the line as we moved towards integrating that base level
  knowledge into new forms. This was all part of the first phase of
  makings (1-3) and was a fundamental, rudementary step in this creative
  process. As we've moved into the second phase, we had to think more
  deeply about craft and how we would reflect our intended message and
  theme through a comprehensible and aethetic format. This is where I
  really started to find my own "knack" for the digital media creation
  process. I knew I wanted to do something unique in whatever it is
  I was presenting. Using new media software like Premiere Pro was
  extremely exciting and allowed me to learn new skills on the program.
  Every video compilation/edit I made, I did so with the intention
  to challenge myself to learn a new type of effect for the making.
  The final goal acomloshed in these makings presented itself in the
  character creation making. This new program was very intuitive and
  made the daunting task of character animation seem much more possible.
  Through the entire process, I've been challegned in the best way I
  could have been. Everything I've learned as a result of having to
  craft new skills has only become more smoothly intergrated into my
  creation process which has only led to more advancement in my own
  groove.

          COURSE GOALS ACOMPLISHED THROUGH THE FINAL PROJECT:
        <H1>    Re-integrating elements that we learned at the beginning of the semester into this project into more a developed version shows the progress Iâ€™ve made in this course. To code in buttons that switch from one page to another was something we learned very early, but still something that I developed on a lot in making my own custom sized/shaped/colored buttons. Centering everything, changing the background color, switching font color/size, encoding interactive elements. All these skills could be reflected in final form in this project. It caused me to have to go back and refocus on different skills that shows this sort of "full circle" our learning in the course has made. Through the techniques developed through the semester,
          I was able to maek a very clear and concise layout that guides the user on an intuitive path forward through the slides in a way that is not confusing and very self-explanatory. The buttons used to navigate the slides are marked clearly and customized to be eye-catching in order to grab the audience attention to proceed forward. There are many elements that reflect advanement, such as
The engaging color scheme (Orange, white, and black), the interesting/edgy header image ,  the captivating/entertaining and carefully chosen YouTube video, the following prompts for the user to gather their input/opinions on the video, the minimal yet informative GIFS that are woven into the diagram in such way that is non-distracting yet encapturing, and lastly the Google Survey at the end of the slides. Through all of these elements, the user is sucked into the slides that makes the experience feel continuously fresh as new and different prompts come up for the user.
